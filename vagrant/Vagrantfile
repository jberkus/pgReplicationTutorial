  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:15432" will access the postgres port on the guest machine.
  # config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 5432, host: 15432

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.199.101"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network
  # config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "44.44.44.100"

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  #
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
  #   # Don't boot with headless mode
  #   vb.gui = true
  #
     # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example to change memory:
     # memory is set to 384MB
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "384"]
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnshostresolver1", "on"]
     vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--natdnsproxy1", "on"]
  end

  # provision
  config.vm.provision :shell, :path => "bootstrap.sh"
